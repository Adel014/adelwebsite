<h1>
How
I
Celebrated
My
Last 
Birthday
Party
</h1>
<p>
I
celebrated
my
last
birthday
party
on
the
14th
of
April,
2024.
It
was
an
unforgettable
experience
as
I
celebrated
it
with
family
and
friends.
There
was
lots
of
foods
to
eat,
lots
of
games
to
play
and
most
especially,
lots
of
places
to
go!
</p>
<h2>
Family
Time
</h2>
<p>
I
woke
up
in
the
morning
to
find
all
my
family
members
like 
my
grandparents,
siblings,
aunts 
and
my
uncles,
seated
waiting
for
me
in
the
sitting
room.
It
was
a
splendid
surprise.
</p>
<h2>
The
Birthday
Song
</h2>
<p>
Another
part
of
my
birthday
that
kept
me
smiling
all
day
was
the
birthday
song.
Each
time
they
sang
it,
made
a
wide
smile
unwind
on
my
face.
</p>
<h2>
Food
Galore
</h2>
<p>
If
I
wanted
to write
the
amount
of
food
that
was
on
my
plate
that
day,
you
wouldn't
believe
me!
My
dish
was
filled
with
scrumptious
delicacies
that
had
a
golden
aroma.
I
can
say
that
you
would
be
able
to
smell
the
food
from
three
blocks
away!
</p>
<h2>
B-Day
Outing
</h2>
<p>
On
that
day,
we
roamed
through
the
streets
of
Benin-City,
stopping
at
one
point
to
the
other.
We
had
ice-cream,
pizza,
pastries
and
we
went
shopping!
</p>
<p>
Overall,
my
experience
was
blissful
and
it
had
a
long-lasting
memory
that
I
will
never
forget.
I
can't
wait
for
my
next
birthday!
